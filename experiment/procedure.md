<b> Materials required</b>

* Fat/oil samples
* Analytical balance
* Hot plate
* Burette
* Pipette
* Conical flasks
* Measuring cylinder
* 95% ethanol
* Phenolphthalein indicator
* 0.1 N Sodium hydroxide

<b> Methods </b>
1. Arrange all the prepared reagent solutions and test samples on the table.
2. Accurately weigh 2.0 gm test sample of fat/oil into a 250-ml conical flask. 
3. Add 50 ml 95% ethyl alcohol in to the sample flask
4. Heat the mixture to boiling point and then add 2-3 drops of phenolphthalein indicator in it. 
5. Titrate the hot sample with 0.1 N NaOH with shaking vigorously.
6. Stop the titration when slight pink color appears that persist for 30 seconds.
7. Record the volume of NaOH used. 
8. Calculate the FFA content using the equation below:

   Where, <br>
      V= volume of NaOH used (ml)<br>
      N= Normality of NaOH <br>
      W= weight of sample (gm)<br>

9. Estimate the quality of sample on the basis of determined %FFA value.
